Abstract - This project presents the development and 
evaluation of a course recommendation system leveraging 
machine learning techniques. Utilizing a dataset from Udemy 
comprising over 4 courses, the system aims to assist students in 
selecting relevant courses based on their interests, academic level, 
and subject preferences. Through data preprocessing, feature 
engineering, and similarity calculation using the Jaccard 
similarity metric, the system generates personalized 
recommendations for users. Evaluation of the system 
demonstrates its effectiveness in providing relevant course 
suggestions based on user input. However, challenges such as 
scalability and the need for further optimization and evaluation 
metrics are identified. The course recommendation system 
represents a valuable tool for enhancing the student learning 
experience by facilitating informed course selection decisions. 
Future research could focus on addressing these challenges to 
improve recommendation accuracy and user satisfaction.
