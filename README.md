Abstract - This project presents the development and evaluation of a course recommendation system leveraging machine learning techniques. Utilizing a dataset from Udemy comprising over 4 courses, the system aims to assist students in selecting relevant courses based on their interests, academic level, and subject preferences. Through data preprocessing, feature engineering, and similarity calculation using the Jaccard similarity metric, the system generates personalized recommendations for users. Evaluation of the system demonstrates its effectiveness in providing relevant course suggestions based on user input. However, challenges such as scalability and the need for further optimization and evaluation metrics are identified. The course recommendation system represents a valuable tool for enhancing the student learning experience by facilitating informed course selection decisions. Future research could focus on addressing these challenges to improve recommendation accuracy and user satisfaction. 


WORKFLOW -
A ) Input Data : 
This step involves collecting data from various sources, such as online learning platforms like Udemy. The data typically includes information  about courses (e.g., title, description, level, subject) and user interactions (e.g., views, ratings, purchases). The quality and comprehensiveness of the input data directly impact the accuracy and effectiveness of the recommendation system. lemmatization (reducing words to their base form). NLP techniques help extract meaningful information from textual data, which is crucial for feature engineering. 

B) Data Preprocessing : 
Data preprocessing is essential for cleaning and preparing the raw data for analysis. This step includes tasks such as removing duplicates, handling missing values, and normalizing numerical features. Cleaning the data ensures that it is free from errors and inconsistencies, while normalization ensures that numerical features are on a similar scale, preventing biases in the analysis. 

C) Text Preprocessing (NLP) : 
Text preprocessing involves cleaning and transforming textual data (e.g., course titles, descriptions) into a format suitable for analysis. This includes tokenization (breaking text into individual words or tokens), removing stopwords (commonly occurring words).

D) Feature Engineering : 
Feature engineering involves selecting and transforming relevant attributes from the preprocessed data to create feature vectors that represent each course. This includes numerical features (e.g., course level) and textual features (e.g., bag-of-words representation of course titles). Feature engineering aims to capture important information that can influence 
recommendations and ensure compatibility with machine learning algorithms. 

E) Combine Features:  
In this step, the extracted features are combined into a single feature vector for each course. This combined feature vector represents the course's characteristics, including both numerical and textual features. Combining features simplifies the representation of courses and prepares them for similarity calculation. 

F) Calculate Similarity: 
Similarity calculation involves measuring the similarity between pairs of courses based on their feature vectors. Common similarity metrics include cosine similarity and Jaccard similarity. 
These metrics quantify the degree of resemblance between courses, enabling the system to identify courses that are similar in content or characteristics. 

G) Recommendation Generation: Recommendation generation involves selecting courses that are similar to those the user has interacted with or shown interest in. Based on the user's past interactions and preferences, the system identifies a subset of courses that are likely to be of interest to them. The recommendations are ranked based on their similarity scores or other 
relevance metrics. 
 
H) Output Recommendations: 
Finally, the recommended courses are presented to the user for further exploration or consideration. The recommendations include additional information about each course, such as its title, level, subject, and any other relevant details. Providing comprehensive information helps the user make informed decisions about which courses to pursue.courses, enabling the system to identify courses that are similar 
in content or characteristics.
